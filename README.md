# LatentSpaceGeometry
This project is the culmination of months of reflection on the evolution of the software developer profession with generative AI.

Initial Observation: An AI model is the compilation of the state of the art at a given moment. In other words, the model contains only known concepts, yet it masters this known world optimally.

Consequence: The added value of a developer compared to AI can truly be revealed only beyond what is already known. A software developer must now be able to propose new concepts.

Implication: The developer must therefore know how to effectively create the unknown that is functionally correct, because it is on this point that the quality of their work is judged.

Functionally correct unknownâ€”this is a form of paradox!

However, it is a paradox well understood by mathematical abstraction: in a mathematical equation, we do not know x, yet we can still affirm truths about x.

Here is the concept: **leveraging the power of AI to mathematically innovate.**

`LatentSpaceGeometry` is an implementation of geometric transformations on the latent space of an AI model that the `FoundationModels` framework makes accessible in Swift.
